# Udacity Portfolio Project

This was the first project for Udacity Grrow with Google Scholarship. The project was to create a portfolio
website based on the provided mockup. This project was my first ever attemp to code and it is exactly how I first created - with all the html, css, png, jpg files in one folder. I purposly did not "clean up" the code later, so it shows where I was about 3 months into my coding journey.

The files (index.html, index1.html, index2.html, index3.html and the same with the *.css files) show stages of my project. At the time I did not know how to use git and GitHub and that I could keep track of the progress in the project by pushing it into GitHub. 

To see the final version of the project one needs to look at the index3.html and main3.css files. The mockup, which was provided to students, is the .pdf file.
